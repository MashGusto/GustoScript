#GustoScript
This is the first programming language I made.

#Usage
On the terminal, use the `bin/gs` command (or wherever the binary is located) with the filename of your script (ending with .gs) as the argument.

#Docs
This programming language currently has a `write` keyword, which is used to print out stuff to the console.
